Add/Enhance Features:"Add sorting to match cards on player page (by date, result, opponent) using React state. Include basic stats on match cards like game length, opening name from chess.js."
"Integrate search: Use fuzzy matching for player names/ID; highlight results in the home grid using react-autosuggest."
"For analysis, use Stockfish.js for client-side eval if Chess-API.com fails; show move-by-move walkthrough with comments on best moves."
"Add infinite scroll for loading more games on player pages via API."
"Implement dark mode toggle with space variants (deep space vs. nebula) using CSS variables and localStorage."

Theme and UI Refinements:"Enhance space theme: Add neon glow to player/match cards on hover; configure tsParticles for galaxy effect with twinkling stars."
"Make player cards interactive: Orbiting stats icons (e.g., wins as stars); use Orbitron for headers."
"Improve responsiveness: Grid layout for cards on desktop, stack on mobile; ensure boards resize."
"Add holographic tooltips for stats using react-tooltip with custom CSS glows."

Bug Fixes and Optimizations:"Fix CORS in API calls: Use proxy if needed for Chess.com/Lichess, or confirm endpoints support client-side."
"Optimize fetches: Cache recent games locally with useEffect; throttle analysis requests."
"Handle null usernames: Show message like 'No online account available' for older champions."
"Add error handling for API failures; fallback to static JSON data."

Animations and Particles:"Add hover glow and scale to cards using framer-motion (scale 1.1x with pulse)."
"Implement orbital entrance animations for player cards on load using react-spring."
"Add particle bursts on game events (e.g., win) using tsParticles emitters."
"Create vortex loader for API fetches with tsParticles swirls."
