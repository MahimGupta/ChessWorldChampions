Install Git and clone my repo https://github.com/MahimGupta/ChessWCApp.git and help me.

I want to make some small changes and updates, and then push it to a new github later (so remove the git stuff).

I want you to fix the api data loading etc, because when I load this current version I get: Failed to load champions data where the champions should be, and when clicked on a champion even if shown, it doesn't load their games only their stats properly. Please check these and fix them so they work!

I'll help you work with your existing Chess World Champions app. Let me first search for information about your repository to understand what we're working with.


Visited https://github.com/MahimGupta/ChessWCApp
Perfect! I can see this is a Chess World Champions app built with TypeScript, React, and Express. Based on your description, you're experiencing issues with:

Champions data not loading ("Failed to load champions data")
Games not loading when clicking on a champion (only stats work)
I'll create a plan to clone your repository, fix the API data loading issues, and prepare it for you to push to a new GitHub repository later.

App type
Modern web app
Fix API data loading issues in Chess World Champions app - champions list and individual champion games not displaying
I'll include the following features:

Clone existing ChessWCApp repository and remove git configuration for fresh start
Debug and fix champions data loading API endpoint to resolve 'Failed to load champions data' error
Fix individual champion games API endpoint to properly load game history when champion is selected
Verify champion stats are loading correctly (already working but ensure no regression)
Test full data flow from backend API to frontend display for both champions list and games
Ensure all existing TypeScript, React, and Express functionality remains intact

I can see this is an empty Replit project, but you want me to clone your existing Chess World Champions app from GitHub. Let me install Git and clone your repository first.


Installed git
Now let me clone your repository and then check what files exist:


Executed cd /home/runner/$REPL_SLUG && git clone https://github.com/MahimGupta/ChessWCApp.git temp_clone && rsync -av temp_clone/ . && rm -rf temp_clone
Let me use a different approach:


Executed cd /home/runner/$REPL_SLUG && git clone https://github.com/MahimGupta/ChessWCApp.git temp_clone && cp -r temp_clone/* . && cp -r temp_clone/.[!.]* . 2>/dev/null; rm -rf temp_clone

Executed cd /home/runner/$REPL_SLUG && rm -rf temp_clone && git clone https://github.com/MahimGupta/ChessWCApp.git temp_clone && cd temp_clone && cp -r * .. && cp -r .[!.]* .. 2>/dev/null; cd .. && rm -rf temp_clone
I see the issue - I can't overwrite .replit. Let me copy only the relevant files:


Executed cd /home/runner/$REPL_SLUG && rm -rf temp_clone && git clone https://github.com/MahimGupta/ChessWCApp.git temp_clone

Executed cd /home/runner/$REPL_SLUG && cp -r temp_clone/client . && cp -r temp_clone/server . && cp -r temp_clone/shared . && cp -r temp_clone/data . && cp -r temp_clone/attached_assets . && cp temp_clone/package.json . && cp temp_clone/package-lock.json . && cp temp_clone/tsconfig.json . && cp temp_clone/vite.config.ts . && cp temp_clone/tailwind.config.ts . && cp temp_clone/postcss.config.js . && cp temp_clone/drizzle.config.ts . && cp temp_clone/components.json . && cp temp_clone/design_guidelines.md . && cp temp_clone/replit.md . 2>/dev/null; echo "Files copied successfully"
Good! Now let me check what we have and remove the git configuration:


Executed cd /home/runner/$REPL_SLUG && rm -rf temp_clone .git .gitignore && ls -la

Searched Replit documentation for "How to work with existing git repositories in Replit workspace without modifying .git directory"
Perfect! Now let me check what data files exist and examine the current project structure:

Opened home directory
Excellent! Now let me examine the key files to understand the existing app structure and identify the API loading issues:


Show 4 more

Opened client/src/lib/api.ts
Now let me check the shared schema to see the type definitions:


Show 2 more

Opened replit.md
Perfect! Now I understand the issue. Let me install dependencies and start the app to see the actual error:


Agent ran into an error
Let me check if the dependencies are already installed by looking at the node_modules:


Executed cd /home/runner/$REPL_SLUG && ls -la node_modules 2>&1 | head -20
Good! Dependencies are installed. Now let me start the workflow to see if there are any errors:


Restarted Start application
The workflow failed. Let me check the logs:

Checked system logs
Perfect! Now I can see the issues. The app is missing several dependencies. Let me install them:


Installed chess.js, chessboardjsx, react-infinite-scroll-component, @tsparticles/react, @tsparticles/slim, fuse.js, react-circular-progressbar
Great! Now let me restart the workflow to see if there are any other issues:


Restarted Start application
Good! The workflow is running. Let me check the logs to see if everything is working now:

Checked console and system logs
Excellent! The server is running and the API endpoint /api/champions is working (returning 200). I can see it's successfully fetching champions data. Let me wait a moment and check the browser console logs to see if there are any frontend errors:


Executed sleep 3
Checked system logs
Perfect! The API is working - I can see /api/champions is returning 200 with champion data. Let me now check the full workflow log to see the complete picture and then analyze the actual problem:

Reading log files in detail
Good! The server is running fine and the champions API is working. Now let me check if there are any TypeScript or import errors by examining the code more carefully. Let me check a few key components to see if there's an id field issue:


Agent ran into an error
